## Machine-learning
An learning ai that learns how to play pong against the player

## Features

- [Neural Networks](link)
- [Learning algorithm](link)

## Software Analasis 
I chose to work with unity since it is easy to visualise a game there.
A lot of my experiences with programming came from this engine which makes it little more easier for me.

Apart from my statement it's a object oriented based language which has a strict way of scripting in comparison with javascript or python.

Python is one of the best languages that is fit to make ai and especialy learning ai. 
This is because of it's way to construct variables and retrieve data in a simple fashion.

In this case you might be wondering why I chose to create it in Unity c#.
If I were to create an agent in python, that would also need to be proven by visualising the practicallity.
Unfortunately python doesn't have the strongest forte in graphics even if getting help from external libraries.

Unity however is already oriented to a fully build engine and library that contain those tasks.
I chose Unity no for this reason but because the ai doesn't process complex tasks. 
In that aspect python would've been a more optimal decision.

## Learning goals 
- How to make an ai learn
- Getting a grasp on machine learning and neural networks

## Planning 
| | monday | tuesday | wednesday | thursday | friday |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|week 1 | Documentation setup en research | extra research | make pong | extra day to finetune pong | create a neural network class |
|week 2 | create a script for the machine learning | experimenting with behaviour | extra day to polish on anything |
